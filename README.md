## Methodology

### Optimal Transport Particle Filter
This method uses Optimal Transport to resample particles in the filter, which helps in maintaining a diverse set of particles and avoids issues like particle degeneracy.

### Auto Differentiation
Auto Differentiation is utilized to automatically compute the necessary gradients, making the state estimation process more accurate and efficient. This approach is particularly useful in non-linear dynamic systems where traditional methods struggle.

### Implementation Details
- **Transition Function**: Models the state transition with added noise.
- **Likelihood Function**: Computes the likelihood of observations given the current particle states.
- **Resampling**: Uses the Sinkhorn algorithm from the POT library to perform Optimal Transport resampling.

### Code Structure
- `transport_optimal.py`: Contains the main particle filter implementation with Optimal Transport resampling.
- `auto_differentiation.py`: Demonstrates the use of Auto Differentiation in state estimation.

## Results
The project includes visualizations that compare true states, classical estimates, and differentiable estimates over time. The results show the effectiveness of combining Optimal Transport and Auto Differentiation in improving state estimation accuracy.
